# Todos Backend

Hello Specker, welcome to the solution branch!
Here can find the solution to the tasks by searching for `TASK` in the source code: 

1. Count the number of HTTP calls handled by Flask. Please name the metric `app_flask_http_request_total` with the labels `endpoint` and `status_code`.
2. Measure the execution time of the different database operations. Please name the metric `app_repository_query_duration_seconds` with the label `query`.
3. Register a custom collector to export the count of Todos in the database broken down by status (active vs. inactive). Please call the metric `app_current_todos` with the label `status`.

Hope you had fun, see you next time ðŸŽ‰
